# Lost Inspired Countdown

#### Open start.bat to begin the program (Windows only)

This is a Python program that acts like the countdown in the Swan station from the TV show Lost. Upon reaching 0 on the timer the user's computer will lock. (Windows only)

By default the program is set to 108 minutes, you can change to 108 seconds (for demo purposes) by deleting 'time.sleep(60)'
